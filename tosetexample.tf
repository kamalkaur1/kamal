 One shared App Service Plan named asp-shared.
 Three separate Linux Web Apps created automatically from the list:

 riidoz-ui
 gamecb-core

Variable Block
 variable "apps": Defines a variable called apps.

Service Plan Resource
 resource "azurerm_service_plan" "plan": This creates an Azure App Service Plan, with the local Terraform name plan.

os_type = "Linux": Specifies that this plan is for Linux apps.
sku_name = "B1": The pricing tier will be B1 (Basic), which is an entry-level paid tier.

 Linux Web App Resource
 resource "azurerm_linux_web_app" "app": Declares an Azure Linux Web App resource, with the Terraform name app.
 for_each = toset(var.apps): Loops over the list of app names defined in the variable, turning it into a set. Terraform will create one Web App for each item (inovocb-api, riidoz-ui, gamecb-core).

 service_plan_id = azurerm_service_plan.plan.id: All the Web Apps share the same App Service Plan created earlier (asp-shared).
